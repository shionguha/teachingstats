teachingstats
=============

This is a repository which contains a compilation of some code for understanding and teaching key statistical principles through visualization. I am not responsible for the performance, ownership or copyright of any of this code in any form. Use it at your own peril.

**Descriptions:**

perceptron.html - A visualization of the perceptron algorithm with interactivity for fixing mis-classified points. Sample picture here: https://github.com/shionguha/teachingstats/blob/master/perceptron.png

freq_versus_bayes_agree.R - A mini tutorial demonstrating a simple 2 group comparison using both frequentist as well as Bayesian perspectives as well as showing an example of when these 2 approaches agree well with each other.

viz_understanding.R - A poorly performing naive time series model on weightlifting data to demonstrate why analysis without visualization is not a great idea.
